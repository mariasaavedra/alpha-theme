      <h2>How long does it take for domestic (U.S.) orders to arrive?</h2>
      <p style="border-top: #e2e2e2aa solid 1px;padding-top: 2em;">
        Most USA orders arrive within 2-7 business days. <br><br>

          Please allow up to 1-3 business days to process your order. Please be advised, receiving an “order confirmation” via email indicating the items selected, does NOT guarantee all items will be in stock. We will notify you by email when your package is picked up by the postal service. 
          We do not ship on Saturdays, Sundays, or holidays. While we will do all we can to ensure your order is delivered on time, Alpha Clothing Co. cannot be held responsible for conditions beyond our control such as severe weather, service interruptions, etc. 
          Once your order has shipped, you will receive an email with tracking number. 
          If there is no one present to accept your package, it will still be left at your house. Alpha Clothing Co. cannot be held responsible for packages once they are delivered.</p>

      <h2>How long does it take for international orders to arrive?</h2>
      <p style="border-top: #e2e2e2aa solid 1px;padding-top: 2em;">Most International orders arrive between 3-5 business days. Due to customs clearance, some orders may take up to 4 weeks. <br><br>

If there is no one present to sign for your package, it will still be left at your house. Alpha Clothing Co. cannot be held responsible for packages once they are delivered. 
International orders are shipped with duties and taxes due upon delivery via our Standard Service. 
*Orders, shipped via Standard, can incur duties and taxes. Duties and taxes are determined by the customs agency within the destination country. Although charges are not always incurred, assessment of duties and taxes will be based on the value of the order and the Tax-free threshold, if it exists, for goods imported into the destination country. Payment of any duties and taxes is the responsibility of the recipient, and these fees are collected at the time of delivery. More information can be obtained by contacting your local customs office.</p>

      <h2>Tracking is telling me my label has been created, but it's not telling me where it is? </h2>
      <p style="border-top: #e2e2e2aa solid 1px;padding-top: 2em;">This means one of two things: It is being processed currently or Fedex missed the initial scan when they picked up your order. Tracking will be updated as soon as FedEx scans the shipment.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <i></i>
      <h2 style="line-height:1.4em;">I noticed I entered the wrong postal code/apartment # and the package is now being returned to sender,<br> what are the next steps to have my package reshipped to me? </h2>
      <p style="border-top: #e2e2e2aa solid 1px;padding-top: 2em;">Once the package has been returned to our Warehouse, we will reach out to the customers in regards to any address issues. Once the package is returned to us, please allow 2-4 business days to reship.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <i></i>
      <h2>Can I exchange my item for a higher priced item if I pay the difference?</h2>
      <p style="border-top: #e2e2e2aa solid 1px;padding-top: 2em;">No. Exchanges are only for items of equal and lesser value. If the exchange is of lesser value, we will provide an online credit for the difference.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <i></i>
      <h2>Will my online gift card expire? </h2>
      <p style="border-top: #e2e2e2aa solid 1px;padding-top: 2em;">No, fortunately, the gift card that we issue online store credit to will never expire.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <i></i>
      <h2>My parcel is marked as delivered, but I haven't received it. </h2>
      <p style="border-top: #e2e2e2aa solid 1px;padding-top: 2em;">If your tracking states your package has been delivered, but you have not received it. Please first check with any surrounding neighbours for anyone who may have accepted the parcel on your behalf. 
<br>
If you had your order delivered to a work place, please check with all employees who may have accepted the parcel.
<br>
Couriers may update the tracking as delivered prior to delivery, so please allow up to 24 hours before assuming the parcel is lost. If after this period, you're still unable to locate your order, get in touch with the support team and where possible, we'll open an investigation with the courier and do our best to help out. </p>
    </li>
    
    
    <li>
      <i></i>
      <h2>Why is my tracking not updating? </h2>
      <p style="border-top: #e2e2e2aa solid 1px;padding-top: 2em;">Orders process within 1-3 days depending on the shipping method chosen. Orders may also take up to another 48 hours to show a tracking update online. We are currently working to make this quicker - through a new shipping partner. If your express order is ever late, we will immediately refund any shipping charges. 
		<br> <br>If you did not receive a tracking link within 1-3 days of your order, please check your Junk/Spam folders, as they sometimes end up in there. If the tracking email is still not found, the email you provided in your order information might have been wrong. </p>
    </li>

      <h2>How do I exchange a product?</h2>

Please make sure that you have carefully reviewed your order before finalising your purchase. Any returns made after this period may be rejected and sent back to the original delivery address.</p>

      <h2>Why is there a customs fee or VAT with my international order?</h2>
      <p style="border-top: #e2e2e2aa solid 1px;padding-top: 2em;">When orders shipped internationally reach the destination country, they may be subject to customs clearance procedures which can cause delays beyond our control, which may be beyond the original delivery estimates. International orders may be subject to import duties or charges implemented by a specific country, we have no control over these fees and are not liable for the charges which may incur.
      <br><br>
        <b>Refusing to Pay Customs</b><br>
If you choose to refuse the customs fee and the parcel is returned back to Alpha, a shipping / handling fee will be deducted from your refund</p>
